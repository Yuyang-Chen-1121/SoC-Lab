2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -6.350 ns between h_counter_reg[5]/C (clocked by clkout_150_d0_clk_wiz_0) and u_gen_pat/addra_reg[5]/D (clocked by clkout_150_d0_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -8.282 ns between v_counter_reg[1]/C (clocked by clkout_150_d0_clk_wiz_0) and u_gen_pat/addra_reg[6]/D (clocked by clkout_150_d0_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -8.635 ns between v_counter_reg[1]/C (clocked by clkout_150_d0_clk_wiz_0) and u_gen_pat/addra_reg[7]/D (clocked by clkout_150_d0_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -8.695 ns between v_counter_reg[1]/C (clocked by clkout_150_d0_clk_wiz_0) and u_gen_pat/addra_reg[8]/D (clocked by clkout_150_d0_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
